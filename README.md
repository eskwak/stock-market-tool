# Custom Stock Analysis Tool
I'm a believer of the "time in the market beats timing the market" approach to investing. That said, I still prefer not to buy at all-time highs. I've grown frustrated with traditional brokerage platforms, which often overwhelm users with complex information that's hard to digest. I'm building this tool to provide targeted insights on stocks and ETFS for long-term investing.

I have not decided which UI tool to use yet. Most likely a dashboard tool.
