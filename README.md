# Custom Stock Analysis Tool
I am a long-term, safe investor who believes in a "buy and forget" approach. I couldn't care less about actively managing my portfolio or trading options. My strategy is simple: diversify and make consistent investments. That said, I prefer not to buy at all-time highs. I've grown frustrated with traditional brokerage platforms, which often overwhelm users with complex information that's hard to digest. I'm building this tool to provide targeted insights on a smalls set of stocks and ETFs I care about.

I have not decided which UI tool to use yet.
